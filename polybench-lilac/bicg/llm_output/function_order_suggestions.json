  "reasoning": "Main first for entry clarity. Then initialization/setup (init_array) early. Place utility num_blocks before its caller (kernel). Put lower-level compute kernels (kernel_q, kernel_s) before the orchestrator (kernel) to respect dependencies and aid debugging. Keep print_array last as a display function. This ordering mirrors the runtime flow (init -> compute q -> compute s -> orchestration -> print) while keeping callees before callers where possible.",
