  "reasoning": "Placement rationale:\n- main first to follow the requested convention of putting the entry function up front for immediate overview.\n- init_array (2) immediately after main as an initialization/setup function that main calls early (improves logical flow of program start-up).\n- num_blocks (0) next because it is a small helper used by the core kernel; placing it before the kernel satisfies the preference of defining called helpers before callers.\n- kernel_x1 (4) and kernel_x2 (5) follow: they are the low-level computational kernels invoked by kernel; grouping them together before the higher-level kernel improves dependency ordering and readability (called functions before their caller).\n- kernel (1) comes after its dependent helpers so the core computation reads naturally and the reader can understand what the kernel invokes.\n- print_array (3) last as a utility/printing function \u2014 placing I/O helpers near the end keeps them out of the primary computational flow and groups utilities separately from core logic.\nThis order improves logical flow (entry \u2192 init \u2192 helpers \u2192 core \u2192 utilities), respects dependencies (called functions before callers where possible), and groups utility functions away from core computation for easier comprehension and debugging.",
