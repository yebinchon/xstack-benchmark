  "reasoning": "Main first for entry and top-down comprehension. init_array (2) follows as initialization/setup used directly by main. num_blocks (0) is a small utility used by kernel, so place it before kernel. kernel_x1 (4) and kernel_x2 (5) are helper compute kernels invoked by kernel; placing them before kernel (1) respects dependency order. kernel (1) then serves as the core computation orchestrator. print_array (3) is a display function and is placed last.",
