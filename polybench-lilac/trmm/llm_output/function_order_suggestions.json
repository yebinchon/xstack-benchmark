  "reasoning": "Placed 'main' first to follow the entry-first principle. init_array (0) is kept early because main calls it and it represents setup/initialization. num_blocks (3) is a small utility required by kernel, so it should appear before kernel. The two kernel helpers kernel_contract (4) and kernel_alpha (5) are placed before kernel (1) so the core computation function appears after its dependencies (improves dependency order and readability). The core kernel (1) follows its helpers so readers see the low-level building blocks before the high-level orchestration. print_array (2) is left last as a display/printing utility, grouped with other utilities and away from core computation. This ordering improves logical flow: entry \u2192 initialization \u2192 helpers \u2192 core compute \u2192 output.",
