  "reasoning": "Main first for entry-point comprehension. Place initialization early (init_array). Put small utility dependency before its caller (num_blocks) and the core inner compute before the orchestrating kernel to respect dependencies when possible (kernel_sum before kernel). Keep the outer kernel after its helpers for clear dependency flow. Finish with output/printing (print_array) as it is typically last.",
