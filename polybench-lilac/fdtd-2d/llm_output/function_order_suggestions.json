  "reasoning": "Start with main to present the program\u2019s entry and high-level flow. Place init_array early as initialization/setup. Then put the utility num_blocks before its caller to satisfy dependency ordering. Group and order the lower-level compute kernels as they are invoked within kernel: kernel_splat \u2192 kernel_ey \u2192 kernel_ex \u2192 kernel_hz. With all dependencies defined, place the orchestrating kernel next. Finally, put print_array last as a display function. This ordering improves logical flow, groups helpers, and ensures callees precede callers where feasible.",
