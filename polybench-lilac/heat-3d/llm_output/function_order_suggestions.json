  "reasoning": "Main first for entry and high-level flow. Place init_array (0) early as setup/initialization. num_blocks (3) and kernel_stencil (4) are utility/helpers used by kernel, so put them before kernel to satisfy dependency order and ease comprehension. Then kernel (1) as the core computation driver that uses those helpers. Finally, print_array (2) last as output/diagnostics. This grouping improves logical flow, respects dependencies, and makes debugging/stepping through kernel and its helpers straightforward.",
