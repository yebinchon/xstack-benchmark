  "reasoning": "Place the entry point first to make control flow obvious. After main, put initialization (init_array, id 0) since main calls it early. Next place small helper functions that the core kernel depends on: num_blocks (id 3) is a simple utility used by kernel, and kernel_stencil (id 4) is the low-level compute routine invoked from kernel. With those dependencies declared, place the high-level kernel (id 1) which orchestrates the computation. Finally place the print/display function (print_array, id 2) last. This ordering improves readability by following the call graph (callees before callers where possible), groups core compute pieces together, and keeps I/O/utility functions in predictable locations for easier debugging and comprehension.",
