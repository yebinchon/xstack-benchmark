  "reasoning": "Place main first as the entry point. Follow with init_array to keep initialization/setup early. Put kernel dependencies before the kernel to respect call order: num_blocks (utility for grid sizing) and kernel_A_mul_B (the inner compute routine) precede kernel. Finally, place print_array last as an output/display function. This ordering improves logical flow (init -> helpers -> core kernel -> output), respects dependencies for kernel, and aids debugging by grouping utilities before their caller.",
