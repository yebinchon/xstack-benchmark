  "reasoning": "Place the program entry first for immediate context (\"main\"). Immediately follow with initialization (init_array, id 0) so readers see setup logic early. Move small utilities used by the core computation (num_blocks, id 3) next, then group the two low-level sweep kernels (kernel_column_sweep id 4 and kernel_row_sweep id 5) together \u2014 these are called by the main computational kernel. Place the core kernel (kernel, id 1) after its callees so callers precede callers where possible, improving dependency clarity and making the control flow easier to follow. Finally put the I/O/display routine (print_array, id 2) last since print/display functions are often considered helpers and are useful to keep at the end. This ordering optimizes logical flow (entry \u2192 init \u2192 helpers \u2192 core \u2192 printing), respects dependencies (called functions before caller kernel), groups related helpers, and aids debugging by isolating core computation after its building blocks.",
