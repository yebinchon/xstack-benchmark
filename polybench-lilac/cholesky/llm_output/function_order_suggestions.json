  "reasoning": "Place main first as the entry point. Put initialization early: init_array (0) is called directly by main. Next, place the utility num_blocks (3), which is used by kernel_polly. Then group core helper kernels kernel0 (4), kernel1 (5), and kernel2 (6) before kernel_polly to respect dependency order (kernel_polly calls them). Follow with kernel_polly (1) as the orchestrator of the computation. Finally, place print_array (2) last as a display/IO routine. This ordering improves logical flow from setup to computation to output while keeping callees before callers where possible.",
