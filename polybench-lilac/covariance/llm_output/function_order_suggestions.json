  "reasoning": "Main first for entry and top-level flow. Initialization/setup next (init_array). Place utility num_blocks before its caller. Group core helper kernels together and in the same logical order they are invoked (mean -> reduce -> cov), all before the orchestrating kernel to respect dependencies and aid comprehension. Keep the high-level kernel after its dependencies for clearer top-down reading. Print/display function last.",
