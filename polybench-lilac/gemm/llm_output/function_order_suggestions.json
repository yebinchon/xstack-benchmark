  "reasoning": "Main first for entry-point comprehension. Place init_array (0) immediately after as early initialization used by main. Then order kernel dependencies before their caller: num_blocks (3) and kernel_dev (4) precede kernel (1) to satisfy call-before-caller and clarify the kernel\u2019s building blocks. Finally, print_array (2) is last as a display/IO routine. This preserves logical flow (setup -> helpers -> core compute -> output), respects dependencies for kernel, groups utilities, and improves debugging by keeping small helpers adjacent and before their use.",
