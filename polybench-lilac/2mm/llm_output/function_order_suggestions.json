  "reasoning": "Keep the entry point first for immediate visibility (main). Place initialization/setup next (init_array, id 1) since main calls it early. Next provide small utility functions and kernel helpers that the core computation depends on: num_blocks (0) is used by the kernel, and the two per-tile computational kernels kernel_A_mul_B (4) and kernel_D_plus_tmp_mul_C (5) should appear before the higher-level kernel so callers appear after their callees. Then place the core kernel (2) which depends on the prior helpers. Finally put print_array (3) last as a display/utility function. This ordering improves logical flow, groups related helpers, and respects dependencies to aid readability and debugging.",
