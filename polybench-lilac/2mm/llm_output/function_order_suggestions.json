  "reasoning": "Main placed first for entry-point clarity. init_array (1) follows to keep initialization/setup early. num_blocks (0) is a utility used by kernel, so it precedes kernel. The two kernel helpers (4: A_mul_B, then 5: D_plus_tmp_mul_C) are grouped before kernel (2) to respect dependencies and follow the logical execution order inside kernel. kernel (2) comes after its dependencies. print_array (3) is last as a display/IO routine. This ordering improves logical flow, keeps called functions before their caller where possible, and groups helpers for better comprehension and debugging.",
