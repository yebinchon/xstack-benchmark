  "reasoning": "Main first for entry. Place initialization early (init_array = 0). Then define helpers used by the core kernel in dependency order (num_blocks = 3, kernel_stencil = 4) so called functions precede their caller. Follow with the core driver (kernel = 1). Keep output/printing last (print_array = 2). This ordering improves top-down readability, respects dependencies, and groups utilities appropriately.",
