  "reasoning": "Place main first as entry point. Follow the invocation sequence in main for clarity: initialization (init_array, ID 0), then configuration utility (num_blocks, ID 1), then the core compute kernel (kernel_y, ID 3), and finally the display/printing function last (print_array, ID 2). None of the helpers call each other, so this respects dependencies while improving logical flow and debugging by aligning definitions with their use order.",
