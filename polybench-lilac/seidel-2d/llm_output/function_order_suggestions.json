  "reasoning": "Main first for entry and high-level flow. Place initialization next (init_array) to keep setup close to main. Then put kernel dependencies before their caller: num_blocks (utility helper) and kernel_stencil (compute helper). Follow with kernel which uses both. Finish with print_array as display/output typically comes last. This order respects dependencies, groups helpers, and improves logical flow and debugging.",
