  "reasoning": "Keep the entry point first (main) as requested. Immediately follow main with initialization/setup functions (init_array, id 0) since main calls it early. Next place small utility helpers that kernel depends on (num_blocks, id 3) and the core per-thread computation (kernel_stencil, id 4) so that the heavier orchestrator (kernel, id 1) can appear after its dependencies. Finally place the I/O/display helper (print_array, id 2) last. This ordering preserves logical flow: main \u2192 initialize \u2192 helpers \u2192 core compute \u2192 driver \u2192 print, and ensures callers generally appear after the main entry while dependencies for kernel are defined before kernel to improve readability and debugging.",
