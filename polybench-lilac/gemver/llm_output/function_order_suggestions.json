  "reasoning": "Main first for entry-point clarity. Place init_array (0) early as initialization precedes computation. num_blocks (3) is a small utility used by the orchestrator, so put it before kernels. Order compute kernels by the logical flow invoked in kernel: kernel_A (4) to update A, then kernel_x (5) uses A and y, then kernel_y (6) updates x with z, and finally kernel_w (7) computes w from A and x. Put kernel (1) after its dependencies to satisfy call-before-caller where possible. Keep print_array (2) last as an I/O/display routine.",
